draw a simple digital clock. This shows that Eve has a built in ticking clock which
creates new #time records every second
```
  match
    [#time hours minutes seconds]
  bind
    [#div text: "{{hours}}:{{minutes}}:{{seconds}}"]
```



draw a simple digital clock AGAIN! This shows that Eve code can be duplicated and still
perfectly valid!
```
  match
    [#time hours minutes seconds]
  bind
    [#div text: "{{hours}}:{{minutes}}:{{seconds}}"]
```
