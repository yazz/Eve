The most basic Eve program
```
    match
        [#a_number value]
    bind
        [#div text: "hello world {{value}}"]
```


Set up the initial values (See, the order of the blocks of code does not matter as
now this is after the code to display the value)
```
    bind
        [#a_number value: 2]
```
